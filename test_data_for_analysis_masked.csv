"Test result data for estimation of time-varying sensitivity of RT-PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Dataset contains 5725 test results for 3272 unique cases (see Supplementary Material for details). Note, these data have been masked to protect privacy of individuals. Specific dates of test results and symptom onset dates have been replaced with a single field 'days_since_onset': the number of days from symptom onset on which the test was conducted. Individuals are also characterised as having symptom onset in one of three time periods, though the order of individuals within each time period has been randomised. The masked dataset is sufficient to reproduce the results in the analysis.    ",,,,,,,,
